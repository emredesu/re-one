<b>3- Multiple endings!</b>

<b>4- A highscore system that rewards skill for replayability!</b>

seriously though this is just a badly made bullet hell game please don't expect anything (＠＾◡＾)

<b>Known issues</b>
* Movement stops when the player spams space instead of holding it. This is a problem with the way Pygame handles input but I might try to fix it one day (probably not).
